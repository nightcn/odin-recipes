                        Microwave on full power for 5 minutes. Turn potato over, and microwave until soft,<BR>
                        about 5 more minutes.

                        Beat egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment until foamy.<br>
                        Add white sugar and beat until egg whites are glossy, fluffy, and hold soft peaks.

                        Spoon a small amount of batter into a plastic bag with a small corner cut off and pipe a test disk of batter,<br>

                        a peak instead of flattening immediately, gently fold batter a few more times and retest.

                        Pipe batter onto the baking sheet in rounds, leaving space between the disks.<br>
                        Let piped cookies stand out at room temperature until they form a hard skin on top, about 1 hour.
